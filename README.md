packer templates for windows
========================

These are example templates to go with [packer-community/packer-windows-plugins](https://github.com/packer-community/packer-windows-plugins). Files ending in `.example` will need to be customized and may even require leg-work on your part (i.e., entering license-keys, downloading vm tools, etc).

### credits

These examples borrow heavily from [this blog post](http://engineering.daptiv.com/building-a-windows-vagrant-base-box-with-packer/) and also these two fine repos:

- [joefitzgerald/packer-windows](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/packer-windows)
- [box-cutter/windows-vm](https://github.com/box-cutter/windows-vm)

I expect any advances made here to get rolled into [joefitzgerald/packer-windows](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/packer-windows) when WinRM in [Packer](http://packer.io) is stable enough.
